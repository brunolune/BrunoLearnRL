# LearnRL
DataScientest Bootcamp - RL project 

This is a copy of UC Berkely famous AI Pacman programs !!

I have completed the first assignment concerning valueIterationAgents.py that examplifies Dynamic programming for a simple example. 

I think it will be a good set of programs to start learning about Reinforcement Learning.
